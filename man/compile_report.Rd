\usage{
compile_report(file, quiet = FALSE, factory = getwd(),
  encoding = "UTF-8", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the full path, or a partial, unambiguous match for the Rmd
report to be compiled.}

\item{quiet}{a logical indicating if messages from rmarkdown compilation
should be displayed; \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{factory}{the path to a report factory; defaults to the current working
directory}

\item{encoding}{a character string indicating which encoding should be used
when compiling the document; defaults to `"UTF-8"`, which ensures that
non-ascii characters work across different systems}

}
\description{
This function can be used to compile a report using its name, or a partial
match for its name. The full path needs not be specified, but reports are
expected to be inside the \code{report_sources} folder (or any subfolder
within). Outputs will be generated in a named and time-stamped directory
within \code{report_outputs}.
